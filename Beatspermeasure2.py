#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Recall our earlier problem where you printed out beats based
#on measures and beats per measure (3.3.5 Coding Exercise 1).
#In that exercise, you printing out 1 through the number of beats
#in a measure over and over depending on the number of measures.
#
#Copy and modify your code, but this time, you should replace the
#number 1 with the number of the current measure. So, the first
#number in each measure will always rise.
#
#For example, instead of 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 (with each
#number on its own line), you'd now print 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 3 2 3 4,
#and so on.
#
#You can use our sample answer from that problem if you'd prefer.
#
#HINT: One approach would involve adding a conditional.


#Add your code here! Using the original values of the variables
#above, this will initially print the following numbers (but each
#on their own line):
#1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 3 2 3 4 4 2 3 4 5 2 3 4

bpm_list = list(range(1,beats_per_measure+1))    
for i in range(1,measures+1):
    for beats in bpm_list:
        print(beats)
    bpm_list[0] += 1 
    
 SAMPLE:
    beats_per_measure = 4
measures = 5

#Start from our previous code, the change we need to make
#is to what is printed and when.

for measure in range(0, measures):   
    for beat in range(1, beats_per_measure + 1):
        
        #Previously, we always printed the current value
        #of beat. However, we no longer always want to
        #do that, so we'll comment out what was here:
        #print(beat)
        
        #What we print depends on the value of beat. If
        #beat is 1, then we want to print the current
        #value of measure. However, we started the measure
        #range at 0, so we want to add one to it before
        #printing it:
        if beat == 1:
            print(measure + 1)
        
        #If beat wasn't 1, then we print beat as usual:
        else:
            print(beat)
